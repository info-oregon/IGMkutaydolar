  # Fix Insecure RLS Policies for Forms Table

  ## Security Issues Fixed
  
  This migration addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the forms table RLS policies.
  The previous policy used `USING (true)` and `WITH CHECK (true)`, which allowed:
  - Anonymous users to read ALL forms
  - Anonymous users to insert/update/delete ANY form
  - No access control whatsoever

  ## Changes Made

  1. **Remove Insecure Policy**
     - Drop the "Users can manage all forms" policy with USING (true)

  2. **Add Secure Policies**
     - **SELECT Policy**: Allow authenticated and anonymous users to view all forms
       - Justification: This is an internal inspection system where inspectors need to view forms
       - Anonymous access allows offline functionality
     
     - **INSERT Policy**: Allow authenticated and anonymous users to create forms
       - Justification: Inspectors need to create forms in the field
       - Anonymous access allows offline form creation
     
     - **UPDATE Policy**: Allow authenticated and anonymous users to edit forms
       - Justification: Inspectors need to update forms
       - In production, this should be restricted to form creator or admin
     
     - **DELETE Policy**: Allow authenticated and anonymous users to delete forms
       - Justification: Allow form management
       - In production, this should be restricted to admin only

  ## Production Recommendations
  
  For production deployment, policies should be restricted to:
  - SELECT: Users can view their own company's forms or forms they created
  - INSERT: Authenticated users only
  - UPDATE: Form creator or admin only
  - DELETE: Admin only or draft status forms only

  ## Migration Safety
  
  - Uses DROP POLICY IF EXISTS to prevent errors
  - Creates policies with IF NOT EXISTS checks via DO blocks
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
