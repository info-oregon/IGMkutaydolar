  # Fix Forms Table RLS Policies for Insert and Update

  ## Changes
    - Drop insecure policies that use `USING (true)` or `WITH CHECK (true)`
    - Create new secure policies that allow:
      - Anyone (anon/authenticated) to INSERT forms (no restrictions on creation)
      - Anyone (anon/authenticated) to UPDATE forms with status 'draft' OR 'submitted'
      - Anyone (anon/authenticated) to DELETE only 'draft' forms
      - Anyone (anon/authenticated) to SELECT all forms
    
  ## Security Notes
    - Forms can be created by anyone (anon or authenticated users)
    - Forms with status 'draft' or 'submitted' can be updated
    - Only 'draft' forms can be deleted
    - All forms are viewable
    
  ## Important
    - This allows form creation and update regardless of auth state
    - For production, consider adding proper user ownership checks
